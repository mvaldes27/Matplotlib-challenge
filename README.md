## This study analyzes the effects of pharmaceuticals on mice being treated for squamous cell carcinoma over the course of 45 days. The purpose of the study was to compare the performace of Capomulin versus other treatment regimens. 

*This dataset is slightly more representative of male mice than female mice, with a males making up 50.4% and females making up 49.6%. 

*Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be the most successful treatment regimens. This is implied by lower final tumor volumes, and more total measurements.

*There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
